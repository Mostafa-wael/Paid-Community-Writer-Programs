- **What should I write about?**
    - Basic Linux system administration: Are you a whiz at setting up SSH keys? Are you the one people come to when they can't find a file? Is your knowledge of environmental variables the envy of all? Share what you know by submitting a tutorial about system administration.
    - Linux tools: Are you a grep power user? Do you use Rsync to make backups a breeze? Are your systemd service files second to none? Help others reach your level of expertise by proposing a tutorial about Linux tools.
    - Docker tutorials: Do you make YAML files in Docker Compose that are works of art? Do you excel at keeping your Docker images clean? Does your Docker monitoring leave no container in the shadows? Give the community the benefit of your experience by writing a tutorial about Docker.
    - Security topics: Do you have fun configuring firewalls? Is WireGuard part of your standard toolbox? Have you got Suricata on speed dial? Help others secure their installations by submitting a tutorial about security.

  - What is the payout structure?
    - Authors typically receive **$300** per tutorial upon publication. The author then selects a single tech-focused charity or nonprofit or a group of nonprofits united by similar missions to receive a donation from DigitalOcean.
    - Most new tutorials are paid out at **$300**; complex production-focused topics may be paid out at up to $400. Updates for existing tutorials, such as distribution changes, are typically paid out at **$75** to **$150**, based on the number of changes and technical content. All payouts are at editorial discretion. 
  - **Submission Guidelines**
    - Apply: Apply to the program with your topic idea, an outline of your tutorial, and a writing sample that showcases your ability to explain your technical knowledge to others. We publish only original, first-run content under a Creative Commons license.
    - Collaborate: If you're accepted, you'll work with the editorial team to refine your topic and outline for your tutorial.
    - Write: Once your topic is approved, it's time to write. We provide resources to help you get started.
    - Review: Submit your first draft and collaborate one-on-one with a professional editor to prepare your work for publication. The editor will complete a technical review and will provide developmental feedback about your work.
    - Revise: Based on your editor’s notes, you’ll revise your tutorial. (Sometimes a few times!) Our goal is to ensure that your tutorial works (technically), aligns with our style, and will help our community grow their skills.
    - Publish: After revisions, your editor will send your payment, publish your article, make your charitable contribution—and ask what you want to write about next. DigitalOcean will also promote your article across all of our social networks (Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook).
    - Repeat: Build a relationship with the editorial team by suggesting new articles that you want to write.
