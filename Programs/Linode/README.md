  - **Types of documentation?**
    - Tutorials: An exploration of a technology's capabilities, but without a specific end-goal (example: Solving Real World Problems With Bash Scripts - A Tutorial).
    - How-to Guides: Guides that result in a ready-to-use installation of server software, similar to a recipe (example: How to Deploy Istio with Kubernetes).
    - Overviews: Conceptual overviews of a technology (example: A Beginner's Guide to Kubernetes).
    - Troubleshooting: Help guides for a given technology (example: Troubleshooting SSH).
  - **Submission Guidelines**
    - Linode's library is hosted on GitHub, and by contributing to the library, you'll be adding to your portfolio on GitHub. Our library is also maintained under the docs-as-code methodology, where the tools you use to write documentation are the same tools used to write software. As a contributor, you'll be:
      - authoring your drafts in Markdown;
      - previewing your drafts with Hugo, our static site generator;
      - version controlling your work with Git; and
      - reviewing Linode's automatic unit tests of your drafts, which will check for spelling, styling, and other issues.
    - Note: If you’re not familiar with one or more of these tools, we’ll provide resources to help you adopt them.
  - **Payment model**
    - You will be paid a minimum of $400 for original guides. Updates to existing guides start at $100 each.
